1. It is better to use interface when various implementations share only method signature. Polymorphic hierarchy of value types. Abstract should be used when various implementations of the same kind share a common behavior. For interface, we could Implement several Interface but in abstract, only one abstract class is allowed. Interface is for the Future enhancement and abstract is to avoid independence.
2. When two or more methods in the same class have the same name but different parameters, it’s called Overloading.When the method signature (name and parameters) are the same in the superclass and the child class, it’s called Overriding. With Overloading, the method to call is determined at the compile-time. With overriding, the method call is determined at the runtime based on the object type. If overriding breaks, it can cause serious issues in our program because the effect will be visible at runtime. Whereas if overloading breaks, the compile-time error will come and it’s easy to fix.
3. Java final keyword is a non-access specifier that is used to restrict a class, variable, and method. If we initialize a variable with the final keyword, then we cannot modify its value. If we declare a method as final, then it cannot be overridden by any subclasses. And, if we declare a class as final, we restrict the other classes to inherit or extend it.
4. Java garbage collection is the process by which Java programs perform automatic memory management. Java programs compile to bytecode that can be run on a Java Virtual Machine, or JVM for short. When Java programs run on the JVM, objects are created on the heap, which is a portion of memory dedicated to the program. Eventually, some objects will no longer be needed. The garbage collector finds these unused objects and deletes them to free up memory.
5. This keyword mainly represents the current instance of a class. On other hand super keyword represents the current instance of a parent class.
6. Yes. This keyword used to call default constructor of the same class and super keyword used to call default constructor of the parent class. This keyword used to access methods of the current class as it has reference of current class. One can access the method of parent class with the help of super keyword.
7. An unchecked exception is an exception that occurs at the time of execution. These are also called as Runtime Exceptions. These include programming bugs, such as logic errors or improper use of an API. Runtime exceptions are ignored at the time of compilation. A checked exception is caught at compile time whereas a runtime or unchecked exception is, as it states, at runtime. A checked exception must be handled either by re-throwing or with a try catch block, whereas an unchecked isn't required to be handled. 
8. Throw is a keyword which is used to throw an exception explicitly in the program inside a function or inside a block of code. Throws is a keyword used in the method signature used to declare an exception which might get thrown by the function while executing the code.
9. RuntimeException is used for errors when your application can not recover. For example, NullPointerException and ArrayOutOfBoundsException. You can avoid a RuntimeException with an 'if' command. You should not handle or catch it.
